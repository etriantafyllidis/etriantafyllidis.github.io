<b> Paper Abstract </b>

Human movement in virtual reality and teleoperation is a complex phenomenon, particularly in 3D space due to the presence of spatial complexities, dimensionalities, translational as well as rotational variations. While a multitude of different metrics exist to measure human performance, a compelling standardized metric that assesses human motion in current work is missing, significantly aggravating inter-study comparability between different studies. Consequently, evaluating human performance in virtual environments has been a long-standing research goal and a standardized performance metric, with the most prominent being Fitts' law, remains largely unexplored, particularly in higher dimensions. The absence of such a metric is primarily attributed to the discrepancies between pointing and manipulation as well as the combination of translational and rotational movements all in one setting. In this work, four designed experiments with progressively higher spatial complexity were conducted to study and compare existing metrics thoroughly. The research goal was to quantify the difficulty of these 3D tasks and model human performance sufficiently in full 3D peripersonal space. Hence, a new model extension is proposed and its applicability is validated across the experimental results, showing improved modelling and representation of human performance than the existing work in combined movements of 3D object pointing and manipulation tasks. Lastly, the implications on 3D interaction, teleoperation and object task design are discussed
