excerpt: 'This paper presents a saliency analysis to determine the most crucial feedback states for motor skills in deep reinforcement learning, showing that using only key states, a simulated robot can perform various locomotion tasks robustly. The suggested approach can be applied to differentiable state-action mappings, like those in neural network control strategies, allowing for the acquisition of various motor skills with fewer sensing requirements.'

This paper presents a saliency analysis to determine the most crucial feedback states for motor skills in deep reinforcement learning, showing that using only key states, a simulated robot can perform various locomotion tasks robustly. The suggested approach can be applied to differentiable state-action mappings, like those in neural network control strategies, allowing for the acquisition of various motor skills with fewer sensing requirements.
