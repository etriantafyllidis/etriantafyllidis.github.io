excerpt: 'The paper introduces a modular framework for training robot hand-arm systems to catch flying objects, combining supervised learning for trajectory prediction and pose ranking with deep reinforcement learning for reaching and grasping actions. Extensive simulations show high success rates with the system generalising beyond its training to catch various household objects.'

The paper introduces a modular framework for training robot hand-arm systems to catch flying objects, combining supervised learning for trajectory prediction and pose ranking with deep reinforcement learning for reaching and grasping actions. Extensive simulations show high success rates with the system generalising beyond its training to catch various household objects.
