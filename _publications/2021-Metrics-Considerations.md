This paper presents an overview of existing methods in assessing human motor performance and considerations for improving presence in telepresence and teleoperation entailing mixed reality technologies. We also outline potential future challenges and frontiers for deriving a standardised set of guidelines for the derivation of a unified immersion framework.
