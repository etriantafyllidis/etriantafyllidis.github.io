excerpt: 'This paper examines how different sensory combinations entailing a full factorial comparison of auditory, visual and somatosensory feedback states, influence motor task performance in 3D space. Through a series of increasingly more complex motor tasks with human subjects, a correlation is established between multimodal interfaces and their effects on motor performance.'

This paper examines how different sensory combinations entailing a full factorial comparison of auditory, visual and somatosensory feedback states, influence motor task performance in 3D space. Through a series of increasingly more complex motor tasks with human subjects, a correlation is established between multimodal interfaces and their effects on motor performance.
