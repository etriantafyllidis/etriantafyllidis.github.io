This paper introduces a new performance metric based on Fitts law, designed to model human motor performance across full 3D space with varying degrees of freedom. This metric serves as a distinctive tool to quantify prevalent VR-based interactions and robotic teleoperation movements, increasing inter-study comparability in these domains.
