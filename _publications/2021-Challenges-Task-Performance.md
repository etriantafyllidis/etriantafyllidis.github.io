collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-Challenges-Task-Performance
excerpt: 'This paper presents and analyses the most widely used human motor performance metric extensions based on Fitts''s law. The aim is to aid the derivation of a unified and standardised metric for measuring and quantifying motor task performance; commonly seen in robotic teleoperation and VR-based interactions in full 3D space entailing varying degrees of freedom.'

This paper presents and analyses the most widely used human motor performance metric extensions based on Fitts''s law. The aim is to aid the derivation of a unified and standardised metric for measuring and quantifying motor task performance; commonly seen in robotic teleoperation and VR-based interactions in full 3D space entailing varying degrees of freedom.
